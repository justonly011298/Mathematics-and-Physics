Various notes on mathematics and physics organized in several volumes. This project is currently incomplete and will remain
so for quite some time.

## Book One: Undergraduate Coursework
A collection of all of the various course notes, homework, quizzes, and exams gathered from several universities.

### Part One: Mathematics
Courses from Calculus to Topology, Applied Mathematics to Number Theory.

### Part Two: Physics
Various courses from standard undergraduate physics. Introductory level to senior/graduate electromagnetism.

## Book Two: Undergraduate Research
Notes from all research that has been conducted between 2012 and 2019.

### Part Three: LoCSST
Notes and miscellaneous work conducted at the Lowell Center for Science and Space Technology.

### Part Four: Whitin Observatory

## Book Three: Undergraduate Work
Miscellanous work on a variety of problems outside of other research duties.

### Part Five: Mathematics
Notes pertaining to work in convex geometry, analysis, series and sequences, and a translation of Vito Volerra's mathematical
biology book into English.

### Part Six: Programming Tutorials
A collection of tutorials in various languages, mostly IDL, C, Python, and Unix/Bash.

## Book Four: Encylopedia Mathematica
